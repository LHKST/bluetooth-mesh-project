## Bluetooth-mesh-project

This project is about creating a mesh-network using bluetooth low energy (BLE). A constraint in classic bluetooth is that you can only connect 7 devices in a piconet. In a scatternet you connect several piconets together.  Newer version of bluetooth allow for meshed networks and for more devices being connected in a star-formation. We are implementing a scatternet (with BLE) using Raspberry PI's which have inbuilt support for BLE. 

### Currently working on

Implementing algorithm for scatternet generation based on BSF-UED.

### Project backlog
1. Connect to a PI over bluetooth low energy to another PI connected to the internet, and vice versa. (FINISHED)
2. Configure a static piconet of seven devices. (FINISHED)
3. Configure a BLE network with more than seven devices. (FINISHED)
4. Implement routing algorithm. (WORKING ON)
