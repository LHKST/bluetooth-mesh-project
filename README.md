## Bluetooth-mesh-project

This project is about creating a mesh-network using bluetooth low energy (BLE). A constraint in classic bluetooth is that you can only connect 7 devices in a piconet (unless you use a scatter-net). Newer version of bluetooth allow for meshed networks which we are trying to implement using Raspberry PI's which have inbuilt support for BLE.

### Currently working on

Configuring a static BLE network with 7 bluetooth devices and implement a dynamic meshed network.

### Project backlog
1. Connect to a PI over bluetooth low energy to another PI connected to the internet, and vice versa. (FINISHED)
2. Configure a static piconet of seven devices. (WORKING ON)
3. Configure a mesh network with more than seven devices. (WORKING ON)
4. Implement routing algorithm developed at KTH.
