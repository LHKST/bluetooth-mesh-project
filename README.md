## Bluetooth-mesh-project

This project is about creating a mesh-network using bluetooth low energy (BLE). A constraint in classic bluetooth is that you can only connect 7 devices in a piconet (unless you use a scatter-net). Newer version of bluetooth allow for meshed networks which we are trying to implement using Raspberry PI's which have inbuilt support for BLE.

### Currently working on

Creating a simple BLE connection between two devices and controlling a PI device over the internet.

### Project backlog
1. Connect to a PI over bluetooth to another PI connected to the internet, and vice versa.
2. Configure a static piconet of seven devices.
3. Configure a mesh network with more than seven devices.
4. Implement routing algorithm developed at KTH.
